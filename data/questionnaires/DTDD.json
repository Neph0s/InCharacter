Individuals scoring high in this dimension are characterized by their focus on self-interest, their ability to strategize and navigate social interactions with guile, and their willingness to employ unethical methods to succeed. High Machiavellian traits indicate a person who sees relationships as opportunities for exploitation, prioritizes personal advancement over moral or ethical considerations, and possesses a calculated approach to interpersonal dynamics.",

This dimension assesses the extent to which an individual seeks prestige, status, and expects special favors from others. High scorers on this dimension exhibit a grandiose view of their own worth, a constant desire for external validation, and a tendency to dominate social interactions to maintain a sense of superiority. Narcissism within the DTDD highlights the pursuit of recognition and superiority, often at the expense of genuine interpersonal connections and empathy for others.",
            "Psychopathy": "Psychopathy, within the DTDD, focuses on amorality, callousness, and a lack of empathy or remorse. This dimension captures traits associated with a disregard for the welfare of others, cynical views of the world, and insensitivity to the emotional or physical harm one's actions may cause. Individuals with high scores in psychopathy tend to exhibit behaviors that are considered socially and morally deviant, showing little regard for conventional ethics or the feelings of others. The psychopathy dimension of the DTDD identifies individuals who are emotionally detached, prone to risk-taking, and indifferent to the moral or legal consequences of their actions."
