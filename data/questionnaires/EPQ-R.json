            "Extraversion": "This dimension measures an individual's level of sociability, liveliness, and activity. High scorers are characterized by their outgoing nature, enthusiasm, and enjoyment of social interactions. They tend to be assertive, active, and seek excitement. Low scorers, or introverts, prefer solitude, are reserved, and require less stimulation from the external world. They may enjoy quiet environments and are more reflective.", 
            "Neuroticism": "euroticism assesses emotional stability and susceptibility to negative emotions. Individuals scoring high on this dimension are more prone to experiencing anxiety, depression, guilt, and low self-esteem. They may react more emotionally to stress and are more likely to perceive ordinary situations as threatening. Low scorers are emotionally stable, calm, and less affected by stress or emotional distress.", 
            "Psychoticism": "Psychoticism reflects traits related to aggressiveness, impulsivity, and empathy. High scores are associated with a tendency towards tough-mindedness, nonconformity, and risk-taking. Such individuals may exhibit hostile or aggressive behaviors and have difficulty in social relationships. Low psychoticism scores suggest a more empathetic, altruistic, and conventional personality, with better emotional regulation and social adaptation.", 
            "Lying": "This dimension evaluates an individual's inclination towards honesty versus a tendency to fabricate or provide socially acceptable answers that may not be entirely truthful. High scores indicate a strong inclination towards truthfulness, reflected in behaviors such as admitting mistakes, resisting the urge to take advantage of others, and showing a consistent adherence to honesty even when it could be personally disadvantageous. Low scores suggest a greater likelihood of engaging in deceitful behaviors, including cheating, evading responsibility, boasting about unearned achievements, and providing misleading information. This dimension contrasts the value placed on transparency and authenticity with the inclination towards deception for personal gain or social approval."
