This dimension captures concerns over partner's love, fear of abandonment, and worry about not being valued or loved in return. High scores in this dimension indicate a person who often doubts their self-worth within the context of romantic relationships, fears rejection, and is preoccupied with the stability of their relationships. Individuals exhibiting high attachment anxiety are likely to experience intense worries that their partners will not reciprocate their feelings or will leave them, leading to behaviors aimed at seeking reassurance and closeness, often at the risk of appearing needy or clingy.",
            "Attachment-related Avoidance": "The Attachment-related Avoidance dimension in the ECR-R measures an individual's discomfort with closeness and dependency in romantic relationships. This dimension evaluates the extent to which a person feels uncomfortable being close to others, sharing personal thoughts and feelings, and depending on romantic partners. High scores suggest a strong preference for emotional distance, self-reliance, and an inclination to keep partners at arm's length to avoid vulnerability. Individuals with high attachment avoidance typically show reluctance to open up, distrust in others' intentions, and a preference for maintaining independence, often resulting in them pulling away when a relationship becomes too intimate or when they perceive too much dependency."
